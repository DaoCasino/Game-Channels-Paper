\section{Preliminaries}
In this section, we introduce definitions and notations that will be used throughout the paper.

We denote the set of integers modulo an integer $n$ by $\mathbb{Z}_n$. When writing $x \xleftarrow{\text{R}} S$ we mean that x is chosen uniformly at random from the set $S$. By $H$ denote some cryptographic hash function. 

The communication model considered a point-to-point channels between two parties. One of them may be malicious adversary. The adversary can divert from the specified protocol in any way.
