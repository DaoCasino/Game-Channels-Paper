\section{Introduction}
	Video games in general, and gambling in particular, require fast interaction between players. Yet most blockchain systems fail to offer high--speed block generation, and the average transaction time is too long as well. For instance, Ethereum generates a new block approximately every 15 seconds \cite{bib2}, while each transaction on average takes 6 minutes \cite{bib3}. Obviously, this is too slow for gaming. Moreover, the transaction fees required will increase the overall session costs.


	Layer 2 solutions \cite{bib4} are designed to remedy this situation. These operate "on top" of existing blockchains. One of these solutions is \textit{state channels}. In this paper we will cover DAO.Casino's state channels, focusing on gambling implementation options.


		\subsection {State Channels overview}
	State channels incorporate instant zero--fee settlements between two channel parties introduce generalized extended functionality to the blockchains with which they are associated. 
	A State Channel operates as follows \cite{bib5}:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Part of the blockchain state is locked via a smart contract, so that a specific set of participants must completely agree with each other to update this state. This state is called the \textit {state deposit}.
		\item Participants update the state amongst themselves by constructing and signing transactions that are submitted to the blockchain.
		\item Finally, participants store the state back to the blockchain, which closes the state channel.
	\end{enumerate}

	In the ideal scenario blockchain participants interact with the channel twice: when the channel is opening and and when the channel is closed in an authorized manner with the updated state deposit.

	Should participants disagree over a result, the channel state is then changed to a \textit {dispute}; the smart contract then acts as an arbitrator in the \textit {dispute resolution} process.

		\subsection {Requirements for state channels}
	Before going into any further detail about state channels, we need to define the basic security requirements. Coleman, Horne and Xuanji \cite{bib1} specify the following two requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Trustlessness - parties who entrust state to a properly initialized state channel should not significantly increase the risk of that state being manipulated. 
		\item Finality - state channel operations have the same degree of finality and irreversibility as the analogous operations performed directly on the chain itself.
	\end{itemize}
	Additional security and computational requirements come from the gambling industry:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Minimal communication complexity in state channels.
		\item Provably fair random number generation support.
		\item Minimal time required for random number generation.
		\item Instant verification of randomly generated numbers.
		\item Once either party makes a bet, one of the parties has to pay the debt to the other at some point. 
	\end{itemize}

	As long as the above requirements are met, fair and convenient gambling is available to all parties involved.

		\subsection {Related works} 
	Payment channels \cite{bib11} are similar to state channels, but a state deposit stores only participant balances. Payment channel networks are built from multiple separate channels that can be coupled when needed. The most popular implementations of the approach are The Lightning Network for Bitcoin \cite{bib24} and The Raiden Network for Ethereum \cite{bib25}. Given that payment channels store no game data, using them in the industry is not practical. 

	State channels were first described in detail by Jeff Coleman in \cite{bib5} and were later considered in other works \cite{bib6, bib7, bib8}. Generalized State Channels defined in \cite{bib1} represent another step forward, enabling users to install new functionality into an existing channel without touching the blockchain. A similar idea was independently developed and implemented in Perun \cite{bib14}. To make state channels more trustworthy, McCorry \textit {et al} \cite{bib9} defined tools preventing execution fork attacks. However, all these works considered general state channel applications without focusing on the needs of the gambling industry.

	Daniel Kraft independently described protocol for turn-based games which also called Game Channels \cite{bib26}. This protocol was implemented as part of XAYA Game Library \cite{bib27}. FunFair \cite{bib15} offers a proprietary implementation of state channels called Fate Channels. In particular, it includes a provably fair random numbers generator based on the commit--reveal pattern for seed generation. Magmo \cite{bib16} developed a framework supporting multiplayer channels. Acebuster designed state channels tailored to poker \cite{bib17}. It is noteworthy that all state channel implementations have limitations in terms of the game types supported.

		\subsection {DAO.Casino's solution}
	For the purposes of this paper all games meeting the following conditions shall be defined as simple pvp--games:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two parties only (e.g. a casino vs. a player);
		\item The game logic may require random number generation;
		\item When either party makes a move, a certain end state can be traced to choose the winner and/or distribute funds among the participants.
	\end{itemize}
	We offer a \textit {Game Channel} technology that allows launching blockchain-based simple pvp--games without fees for additional transactions, and with zero delays between moves/rounds. This solution meets the above--mentioned requirements for state channels.

	Game channels is an instance of state channels tailored to the needs of the gambling industry. Modification of the Signidice \cite{bib18} algorithm is used for provably fair random number generation within a game channel. Signidice generates random numbers from a unique digital signature of one player and a random seed from the other player. It allows a reduction in communication complexity in comparison with the commit--reveal RNG scheme. 

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives basic notations, definitions and a simplified scheme for game channels. In section 3 we provide detailed coverage of the orignal game channel protocol. Section 4 covers a modification of the original protocol for the two player case and comments on delegating blockchain interactions to a third party.
